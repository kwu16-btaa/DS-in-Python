# Applied Data Science in Python
Completed class assignments and projects of Applied Data Science with Python specialty. Jupter notebooks were used to write the code.
##Following code notebooks are included.
1. Assg2-Pandas-Intro.ipynb: In order to complete this assginment, one has to know how to index, slice, sort and group Pandas dataframe objects. 
One needs to use basical aggregation functions to evaluate input variables.
2. Assg3-Pandas-Indepth.ipynb: This file consists of solutions for 13 questions. 
In order to complete this assignment, one needs to use Pandas to first clean data using regular expression. 
group data, merging data and applying statistcal functions to the data sets. Three data sets are used for this assignment.
##Below data sets are included.
1. olympics.csv, this dataset was derived from the Wikipedia entry on [All Time Olympic Games Medals!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-time_Olympic_Games_medal_table). Used in assignment 2 of Pandas. 
2. census.csv: this dataset contains population data from counties and states in the US from 2010 to 2015. 
It is from [United State Census Bureau!] (http://www.census.gov/popest/data/counties/totals/2015/CO-EST2015-alldata.html)
See [this document!](http://www.census.gov/popest/data/counties/totals/2015/files/CO-EST2015-alldata.pdf) for a description of the variable names.
